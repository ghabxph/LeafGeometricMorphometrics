### Protocol step B)11. - Reformatting the ‘master spreadsheet’ ###

# This script converts the master spreadsheet (in which each landmark is listed one after the other) into a format in which each leaf is assigned a single row, with its landmarks as columns. Note that this example uses 17 landmarks and parameters must be changed in order to fit your dataset.
